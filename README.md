# FIRE Calculator ðŸ”¥

A simple Python-based calculator to help users estimate their Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) target and calculate how long it will take to reach it based on their savings and investment returns.

## Overview

This FIRE Calculator app lets users input their annual expenses, current savings, expected annual savings, and anticipated investment return to calculate:
- **FIRE Target**: The amount needed to retire based on a specified withdrawal rate.
- **Years to FIRE**: The time required to reach financial independence given the inputs.

The app is built with Python and Streamlit, making it easy to use and visualize results.

## Features

- Input fields for essential parameters:
  - Annual expenses
  - Withdrawal rate (adjustable)
  - Current savings
  - Annual savings
  - Investment return rate
- Calculation of FIRE target based on the 4% rule (or user-defined withdrawal rate).
- Estimation of years required to reach the FIRE target.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FIRE-Calculator.git
    cd FIRE-Calculator
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

- Annual Expenses: $40,000
- Withdrawal Rate: 4%
- Current Savings: $100,000
- Annual Savings: $15,000
- Investment Return: 7%

The app will calculate:
- **FIRE Target**: $1,000,000
- **Years to FIRE**: Approx. 27 years

## Deployment
